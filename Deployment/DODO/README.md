## What is D.O.D.O ?

In a nutshell, DODO is a PowerShell module that does all the heavy lifting for automated deployment activities.

With DODO, deployment scripts become a lot smaller, easier to write and maintain.
DODO can also take care of operations tasks, such as spinning up new sites and environments with ease.

D.O.D.O's main focus points:
 * Azure Deployments :+1:
 * AWS Deployments (coming soon)
 * VMWare Deployments (coming soon)

See [Documentation](https://github.com/Webjet/DODO/wiki) for more information on how to get started with DODO
